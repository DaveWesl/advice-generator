# My Advice Generator App 

For my challenge, I had to build out this advice generator app using the Advice Slip API and make it look as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools I liked to help me complete the challenge. So, if I had something I wanted to practice, I was free to give it a go.

I aimed for my users to be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
